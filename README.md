# projects
A repo containing previous school and internship projects. 

"Time Series Project" is my final project from PSTAT 174, in which I used Box-Jenkins methodology to analyze, model, and forecast a time series dataset representing CO2 emissions from a volcano in Hawaii using R.  My code is found in the appendix at the end of the report, which was created using RMarkdown.

"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Research Project" is the peer reviewed technical paper I authored describing the rank aggregation decision support tool prototype I made in JavaScript during my time as a Applied Decision Analytics and Visualizations intern at the lab.
